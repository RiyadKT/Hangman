# Hangman

This contains implementations of solutions and algorithms related to the game hangman. They're implemented in the 'Hangman' notebook. You'll be able to find:
- Pruning strategies to reduce computation when finding the 'optimal' strategy : see article
- Neural networks that aim to play the game optimally (see article for more information)
